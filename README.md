# NTIRE2019-Challenge-pksvision

Requirements
=============
1- SciPy

2- Numpy

3- Matplotlib

4- PyTorch

5- OpenCV

To test on custom images
Remove existing files from "Test_Images" or "Test_Results" folders if any.
=============================================================================
1- Install PyTorch

2- Models are stored in Models folder of the current directory

3- Place the test images in "Test_Images" folder in the current directory

4- Open test.py. set the value of m = "image.png". Run "python3 test.py"

5- Results will be stored in "Test_Results" folder in the current directory

6- Due to GPU memory limitatons, we have tested the images one by one. Users are expected to use loop if 
      enough GPU memory available. * We have used 32GB GPU to test an image. *
      
      
Complete training code coming soon..
